debris flow   Initial type of flow (possibilities are streamflow, debris flow annd turbidity current Note:flow volume concentration is the key distinguishing factor for the three flow types)
9.8          Gravity acceleration in m/s^2
1000         Density of the ambient fluid in kg/m^3
0.25         Median grain diameter of the sediment grains in mm
2600         Grain density (quarz) in kg/m^3
0.5          Volumetric sediment concentration of the sediment suspension Note: Cv = Vol_Sedim/Vol_Total 
0.02         Volumetric sediment concentration threshold (between hyperconcentrations and streamflow/density flow)
1            Flow velocity threshold (in m/s) to stop transport and commence deposition 
100          Minumum flow thickness (flow stops and all sediemnt are deposited) in mm
0.10         Rate of sediment deposition from the flow (proportion of the flow thickness)
0            Rate of change of the rate of deposition proportion
10           Concentrate the flow in the direction of max gradient
no           Hemipelagic deposition (yes or no)
0.02         Rate of hemipelagic deposition per time step
2            Number of flow events per iteration
3 3             Sediment entry point y coord (must be consistent with the number of flow events per iteration, different coordinates can be set for multiple sources)
70 140          Sediment entry point x coord (must be consistent with the number of flow events per iteration, different coordinates can be set for multiple sources)
